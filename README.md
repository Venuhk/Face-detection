This repository contains the B.E final year main project source code. project name:Detection of unauthorized human entity in survivallence video

Abstract-- The uniqueness of an individual's face serves as a hallmark of their identity. In this endeavor, we leverage facial recognition technology within a CCTV system to enhance security measures across various industries. With the proliferation of closed-circuit television systems in workplaces, residential areas, and public spaces, there arises a pressing need to bolster surveillance efficacy. By integrating image processing and object detection algorithms into CCTV monitoring, we aim to streamline the identification of unauthorized individuals. Our project focuses on automating the detection of unauthorized persons using CCTV systems. Through this initiative, we propose solutions capable of promptly alerting human operators via email notifications and audible alarms upon the appearance of unauthorized individuals in video footage. By demonstrating the feasibility of early warning systems, we aim to facilitate swifter and more effective responses to potentially hazardous situations, thereby optimizing resource allocation. Central to our approach is the utilization of image processing techniques, particularly face detection and recognition. Face detection enables the identification of facial regions within the video feed, while face recognition compares these detected faces against a database of authorized personnel. When a match is found between a detected face and a record in the database, the system determines the individual's authorization status, thereby discerning between authorized and unauthorized persons. Keywordsâ€”Video surveillance, Histogram, Key frame extraction.
